# hello-world
my first
hey i'm here to try to understand the stuff my Boyfriend is doing for a living. I do not want to work with him, i want to support him or change his view if he is stuck in his work. Also i want to understand what he is talking about when he talks about his day at work. I don't want him to feel he's talking to a wall.
So i give my best in the name of love.
Maybe i'll do something with my favorite Anime or Game since childhood.
